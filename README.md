# Number Filter

## Description

This Java program demonstrates how to filter even and odd numbers from a list of integers.
The `NumberFilter` class provides two methods:
- `removeEvenNumbers` — removes all even numbers from the list.
- `removeOddNumbers` — removes all odd numbers from the list.
The `Main` class creates a sample list of numbers (0 to 10) and showcases how both filtering methods work.

## How It Works

- A list of integers is created in the Main class.
- The original list is displayed.
- The list is passed to the NumberFilter methods to filter out even or odd numbers.
- The filtered results are printed to the console.

## Example Output

```
Original: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Even numbers only : [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Odd numbers only  : [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or command line tools (javac, java

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java files:
```
javac Main.java NumberFilter.java
```

3. Run the program:
```
java Main
```
